# end-to-end-Heart-disease-ML-Project
This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in individuals using a given dataset of features. The dataset contains various medical attributes related to heart health, and our goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify whether a person has heart disease or not based on these features.
